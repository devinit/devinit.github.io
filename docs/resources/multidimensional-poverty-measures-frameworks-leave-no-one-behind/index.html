         This guide seeks to make sense of the growing body of data and evidence around multidimensional poverty, in the context of the

        <p>
         Poverty is now well established as a multidimensional phenomenon where different deprivations – from health status to political power – interact with each other to make it difficult for people to live a full and decent life. There is now a range of indicators, indices and tools that measure poverty in a multidimensional way. Our
         <a href="/resources/what-multidimensional-poverty/">
          briefing
         </a>
         describes the concept of multidimensional poverty and its origins.
        </p>
        <p>
         The leave no one behind commitment puts additional requirements on any data used to analyse poverty. Specifically, it is necessary to be able to disaggregate this data to identify individual and group-based inequalities in poverty outcomes, as well as considering whether people and their voices are included in a meaningful way throughout the data lifecycle.

         This guide does not cover all multidimensional poverty measures but provides a sample of ways that multidimensional poverty can be measured. It summarises the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and presents the main factors to consider with respect to the quality of the underlying data. Critically for data to be useful for a leave no one behind approach, it also presents the scope for disaggregation.

         Examining the strengths and weaknesses of selected internationally comparable and publicly accessible measures and indices of multidimensional poverty
        </h4>
        <p>
         This section reviews measures that are developed at the international level, using standardised data collection tools for universally important dimensions of people’s lives. This generates measures that aim to be relevant to, and comparable for, all countries. They can provide a comprehensive global perspective on who is furthest behind in terms of multidimensional poverty but can limit the extent to which the evidence can be localised, with meaningful inclusion of people’s voices throughout the data life cycle.

        <p>
         Dashboards are used to present indicators for different dimensions of poverty alongside each other. This enables the user to identify the full range of indicators that are included in a multidimensional analysis, understand the outcomes of each dimension individually and analyse the relationship between different dimensions.

            Overview
           </b>
          </h3>
          <p>
           Perhaps the broadest and most universally relevant multidimensional poverty framework is articulated by Agenda 2030, which applies to all UN member states, no matter their income level.
           <a aria-describedby="note-et5D7S8Wm" href="#note-et5D7S8Wm" id="note-source-et5D7S8Wm">

             [1]
            </sup>
           </a>
           The first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) makes it explicit that poverty should be eradicated in “all its forms” – not just in an economic sense – and that this applies “everywhere” – not solely in low-income countries. Although there is a tendency for progress on this goal to be measured only by the international extreme poverty line, there are a range of indicators associated with this goal, which include access to services, rights to land and social protection coverage.
          </p>
          <p>
           Moreover, the 16 other goals in the SDG framework highlight the range of needs that must be addressed to achieve meaningful progress for humanity. These include access to decent work, a clean environment, good healthcare, education and gender equality. The dashboard is vast. Across the goals, there are 169 targets, measured by
           <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/">
            232 separate quantitative and qualitative indicators
           </a>
           , all of which require timely and accurate data for 193 UN member states.

           National statistical offices are officially required to report data for these indicators. However, in 2019 only 20.5% of data series were filled with data sourced exclusively from countries. ‘Missing data’ gaps can be filled by estimates from custodian UN agencies. When there is national data available, it may be out of date due to the methods used to collect it, or other issues such as difficulties with reporting via statistical systems.

          <p>
           Custodian agencies that lead on one or more indicators compile the data from all countries and are responsible for generating comparable regional and international statistics. Custodians use their own methodology for harmonising, adjusting and estimating data. The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) then uploads it into the global indicators database.

            The breadth of multidimensional goals and indicators, along with the international profile of the SDGs, has given rise to parallel reporting mechanisms by civil society groups.

          <ul>
           <li>
            Large number of equally weighted SDG indicators make it difficult to prioritise measures and interpret overall progress in reducing poverty.
           </li>
           <li>
            International measures may not be appropriate to the local context, particularly when they are formulated and estimated by custodian agencies rather than being sourced from national data sources.
           </li>
           <li>
            The nature of data points varies (e.g., sourced nationally or estimated), and a number of datasets have duplicate values, confusing users as to the correct value to be used and what underlying data this is based on.

          </h3>
          <p>
           The P20 initiative has been developed by Development Initiatives to better understand the data on people who are at risk of being left behind. The P20 is a simple concept that seeks to focus political attention on the poorest 20% of people at all levels – globally, nationally, in every sector and every community – so that action can be taken, and policies and resources can be better targeted to ensure that the poorest 20% of people are included in progress.

          </h3>
          <p>
           The P20 initiative uses three key proxy indicators to measure progress: income, nutrition and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS). If data for these three indicators are not going in the right direction for the P20, it is unlikely that other SDGs will be achieved. The P20 approach can also be used to measure changes in other sectors and outcomes based on the priorities of governments and agencies, so that the P20 can be prioritised across all development efforts, and multiple dimensions of poverty.

          <p>
           The P20 approach proposes the use of five core variables to disaggregate the data, comparing the constitution of the P20 with the rest of the population with respect to wealth, gender, geography, age and disability. However, the flexible methodology means that any variable included in the underlying dataset can be used for disaggregated analysis.

        <p>
         Composite indices bring together indicators of different dimensions of poverty to generate a single summary statistic on who is living in multidimensional poverty. International indices use a standardised approach that can be used to compare multidimensional poverty between different countries. There are several different methodologies that can be used to combine the values from different indicators. Each methodology comes with its own implications of the choice of dimensions included and the weighting of these dimensions, which necessarily affects the findings for the scale and depth of multidimensional poverty.

MPI values can be disaggregated for different ethnic groups, urban/rural areas, region, age and other key household and community characteristics. However, as it is derived from household data it cannot be disaggregated by individual or within household characteristics, such as age and gender.

            Individual Deprivation Measure (IDM)
           </a>
           is a gender-sensitive, multidimensional measure of poverty. It uses 15 key dimensions of life – the dimensions which people with lived experience of poverty have deemed to be most important – to measure the poverty of individuals. The index is underpinned by a purpose-built survey tool that captures primary data on every adult within a selected household. This reveals important insights about differences that exist between members living in the same households. The index applies a gender-sensitive framework to identifying the dimensions of poverty that matter, such as unpaid work, time use, access to contraception and menstrual hygiene.
          </p>
          <p>
           The 15 dimensions of individual deprivation are composed of 23 themes and based on 34 individual indicators defined using responses to one or more survey questions. Combinations of responses to one or more survey questions are ranked on an interval scale from 0 (most deprived) to 3 (least deprived), reflecting individual experience of deprivation. An individual’s score for each theme is the mean average of all non-missing indicator scores within that theme, and the individual’s score for each dimension is the mean average of all non-missing theme scores within that dimension. The final IDM score for an individual is the weighted arithmetic mean of all dimension scores.

           This index has been explicitly developed to ensure that data can be disaggregated by individual characteristics by collecting data at the individual, rather than household, level. Information on the ethnicity, religion, age, gender of each individual is collected to highlight how these factors influence deprivation and inequality and interact to deepen disadvantage.

        <p>
         A multidimensional approach can allow for a focus on a particular dimension, depending on the context, and for this to change and evolve over time. Internationally comparable and publicly accessible measures have been developed for some specific dimensions of poverty to enable comparisons between countries on deprivations of particular relevance to specific policy areas and sectors. These are measured by single indicators or a combination that measure different aspects of a single dimension.

          <p>
           Access to digital and communications services and technologies, such as smartphones and the internet, are increasingly recognised not just as enablers to improve poverty outcomes, but as important dimensions of poverty in and of themselves. The internet is often required to access basic services such as banking. During the Covid-19 pandemic, for many the internet became a vital tool in accessing education, healthcare and work. Internet access can improve labour market outcomes as well as helping people stay entertained, informed and able to create connections with others.

           Nutrition is a critical dimension of poverty that goes beyond having enough to eat day to day. There are multiple aspects of nutrition that matter for health and wellbeing in the short and longer term. These can be measured as standalone indicators or combined to give an overall understanding of a person’s or country's nutritional status. The
           <a href="https://globalnutritionreport.org/reports/2021-global-nutrition-report/">
            Global Nutrition Report

           The report sets out progress against internationally recognised global nutrition targets.

          Many of the internationally comparable approaches to measuring multidimensional poverty, including the P20 and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), use data from international household survey programmes. Their main sources are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), an international household survey programme developed by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in the 1990s. Over 300 surveys have been carried out in just under 100 countries.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) is a nationally representative household survey developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the 1980s. Over 300 surveys have been carried out in just under 100 countries.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) is a household survey developed by the Development Research Group at the World Bank in the 1980s. Over 100 surveys have been carried out in just under 40 countries.

           Comprehensive surveys that collect a wide variety of indicators across multiple dimensions of poverty.
          </li>
          <li>
           Nationally representative with large sample sizes, which can allow for geographical disaggregation.

           Repeated periodically using a standardised approach, which allows for comparisons over time and between countries.

           Weaknesses
          </b>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Although designed to be nationally representative, some population groups are missed. This can include marginalised population groups such as people without a permanent address or migrant workers, as well as more privileged individuals who evade door-to-door surveyors.
          </li>
          <li>
           As data is collected at household level, differences between individuals within that household cannot be identified. This limits the potential for disaggregation of outcomes by important variables such as gender and age.
          </li>
          <li>
           Standardised questions and international management of the survey programme can mean that the dimensions of poverty included may not be the most pertinent to the local population – neglecting important dimensions of poverty such as voice and empowerment. The data itself may also not be accessible and understood by the population groups that it relates to, or the national and local governments and agencies that would use it to inform policies and services.
          </li>
          <li>
           Available survey data is often several years out of date by the time it is published, due to the timeframe for conducting the surveys and analysing and publishing the data.

         A number of tools and approaches have been developed that seek to generate a multidimensional measure for poverty that is specific to the lived experience of people within a particular place. In contrast to the data and indices reviewed in Part 1, these are not designed to enable a comparative analysis between countries or provide a global perspective, but rather inform the policies and priorities of actors in a particular context and can include meaningful ways to include people's voices on the aspects of poverty that matter most to them.

         Guidance and resources have been developed for several of the main international multidimensional measures to be adapted to better suit the local context. Standardised methodological frameworks and indicators endorsed at the global level can be adjusted for different contexts including for example by removing, adding or adjusting the weighting of particular dimensions as appropriate.

           A national Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is a country-specific adaptation of the

            Multidimensional Poverty Index

           Like the global MPI, the Malawi MPI is estimated at the national level. It can be disaggregated by region, district, place of residence and sex of household head, but due to the limitations of using household level data it is not possible to measure inequalities within households, such as gender.

         A range of tools and approaches have been designed to ensure that, unlike in some standard household surveys, the most marginalised individuals are explicitly targeted for inclusion in the data collection process. Bespoke questionnaires can also be designed to include dimensions of poverty and variables for disaggregation that are not necessarily on the radar of international agencies, but are very important for local people.

            ‘An Unequal Pandemic’ report
           </a>
           is an outcome of the coalition and was produced by both the Leave No One Behind Partnership and the Inclusive Data Charter, with support from a steering group, including Development Initiatives. Through the use of non-official data, the report aimed to fill and highlight the unequal impacts of poverty and inequality for marginalised groups, which are often not highlighted when only official data is used. It found that the pandemic amplified inequalities relating to health care access, housing and sanitation, while official responses risked further discriminatory practices.

           Official data is categorised as data that is collected through a national statistical office, or through some form of government organisation. Non-official data is data that is collected through non-governmental departments, including the civil society organisations, research institutes and the private sector.

           Data has been collected in countries to specifically enable an understanding of the impacts of Covid-19 on particular marginalised groups, based on their migration status, caste, gender, sex, sexuality, disability, religion, gender and age. However, due to the non-representative nature of the data collection, it is not possible to directly compare between these groups and the national average using a single data source.

           associated with responding to and surviving the 2011 famine and 2016 drought. The study sought to understand local community perspectives on vulnerability and how livelihood and coping strategies are changing as a result of changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events in Somalia.
          </p>
          <p>
           Following a literature review, primary (largely qualitative) data was collected in four locations. General open questions were used to elicit personal perspectives, but respondents were guided to consider potential inequalities. For example, questions asked how women/ female-headed households, or persons with disabilities and their families were affected by the 2011 and 2017 droughts. The data’s consistency was assessed before generating findings and implications for policy and practice. Three key drivers of marginalisation in Somalia were identified: ethnicity/kinship/clan identity, gender and livelihood/employment.

           Development Initiatives was able to disaggregate the data and measure the degree of vulnerability to resilience, shock and stress experienced by each grouping based on numerous factors, including conflict, seasonal dynamics, urban or rural location and the predominant types of livelihoods. The study was to understand the changes in livelihoods for internally displaced people, women, children, youth and persons with disabilities, based on gender, age, location, migration status, and ethnicity, in relation to shocks and crises, and the resilience they had. The LGBTQI+ and Christian community were recognised, but due to contextual sensitivities and a short time frame, the research team were unable to speak or confirm with respondents from these communities.

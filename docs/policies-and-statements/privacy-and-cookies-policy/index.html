          How we use your information
         </h3>
         <p>
          <b>
           Newsletters:
          </b>
          Only with your prior consent, we will occasionally send you information on events, recent work and other information. You can sign up to receive these emails and social media campaigns from us on our newsletter sign up.
         </p>
         <p>
          The legal basis for such processing of your Personal Data is therefore your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). Please note that you are not legally required to provide us with your Personal Data. However, without your Personal Data we will not be able to send you our newsletters as mentioned above.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Photography or video:
          </b>
          If working on a project that requires photography or video, if you provide consent, these might be shared in a range of different ways – for example, on websites, printed documents or as posts on official social media accounts. In such cases, DI will provide a consent form with full details.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Audio recording:
          </b>
          If working on a project that requires audio recording, such as a podcast, DI will process your personal data in this context because it is in the legitimate interests of DI to use the recording. In such cases, we will provide a release form with full details.
         </p>

          We process your data for the following purposes:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We require your details to manage your registration, provide you with the event information and to manage access and participants properly.
          </li>
          <li>
           We may record webinars, including the data listed above, and publish these recordings (on our website, partner websites or third-party website)
          </li>
          <li>
           For some events we may publish the recording on our website, and social media channels, these include but not limited to YouTube, X and Facebook, so this is accessible to a wider audience.
          </li>
          <li>
           We don’t publish delegate lists but your name and email address may be visible to others during the event.
          </li>
          <li>
           We may choose to contact you again after the event to obtain feedback on how well our webinar met your needs. You have the right to decline to participate in either and to ask us to stop contacting you.
          </li>
          <li>
           Data processors: We use Microsoft Teams and Zoom webinar to deliver our webinar and live broadcast events. We use social media platforms to publish the recordings of some events. These sites all drop non-essential cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
           Data transfer: Information might be sent outside the UK when uploaded onto social media sites.

          What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
         </h3>
         <p>
          Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Do you serve targeted advertising?
         </h3>
         <p>
          Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.

         <h3>
          How often will you update this privacy and cookies policy?
         </h3>
         <p>
          We may update this policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

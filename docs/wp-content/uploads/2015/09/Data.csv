Title,"Revised requirements and proportion of requirements met, UN-coordinated appeals, 2014",,
Source,Development Initiatives based on UN OCHA FTS.,,
Notes,"The Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan is not directly comparable to the other appeals: launched in September 2014, its revised requirements of US$1.5 billion covered needs in 2014 and into 2015. Also as a health response it was outside the usual UN-OCHA or UNHCR-led SRP or Refugee Response Plan process. Led by the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, it appealed for development as well as humanitarian resources. Requirements for all other appeals represent the revised requirements at the year end. Funding data is in current prices.",,
